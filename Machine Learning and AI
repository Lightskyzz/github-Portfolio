Planning for an AI agent and machine learning model

In today's age of artificial intelligence (AI), the demand for image recognition models has become
essential across industries from healthcare to retail. My document will outline the steps involved in
creating an AI model for image recognition. It encompasses activities such as data preparation,
categorization, training, validation, model testing, AI agent design, development and assessment.
Each step contributes to ensuring the effectiveness and precision of the AI model in achieving
classification results.
Data Preparation :
The initial stage of setting up an AI model for image recognition focuses on data preparation. This
includes organising the dataset by standardising images and normalising data to ensure consistency
and accuracy during training. The dataset may consist of images categorised into groups like cats,
dogs or other objects. Proper organisation of the dataset is crucial for training and validation
processes. For my AI agent, I collected data from already made datasets from a reputable website
called Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/), In particular, I made use of an extremely detailed cat image
dataset uploaded by Chris Crawford (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/cat-dataset ) which
has over 8000 images and the similarly detailed stanford dogs dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset?resource=download) which
has 20,580 images. Finally, I also chose to make use of a human faces dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwingupta3012/human-faces ) which has over 7200 images. I
chose to use these datasets as they are quite simple to evaluate in terms of their data quality and
integrity but also it would make the process of data preparation much easier as these datasets are
commonly used for projects like image classification.

Categorization :
Following organisation is the categorization phase, This involves assigning labels to each image based
on its category. Creating subsets within the dataset for training, validation and testing purposes is
essential. Accurate labelling is vital for teaching the AI model to recognize categories dividing subsets
and aids in evaluating the model's performance at various development stages. For my AI models
which I trained, I chose to use very simple labels that generally indicated whether a subject was in or
not in the image, for example, two labels could be “Dogs” to indicate there are dogs in the image or
“Not dogs” to indicate that there are no dogs in the image, of course with the cats and humans
models they would follow the same structure.

Training :
Training an AI model entails considering parameters and hyperparameters.
Factors such, as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs and techniques to prevent overfitting
and underfitting are considerations. The batch size determines how many samples are processed
before updating the model parameters while the learning rate controls the size of steps taken during
parameter updates. It is important to choose values for these hyperparameters to improve the
model's performance and shorten the training time. I am using “Google’s Teachable Machine” to
train AI models which my code will then access, I have chosen to keep the batch size as “16” as the
tool mentions that this option does not need to be tweaked in order to affect the performance of the
model, However, I have increased the Epochs to “100”, this is because the AI model will be more
trained on the sample images given which can result in the model being more accurate, I also have
kept the learning rate as “0.001” which is the default, I did not feel confident about increasing the
number as this may affect the quality of the AI models results when trying to predict or classify
images.

Validation :
Validation is a part of the training process as it evaluates how well the model performs on a subset of
data that was not used in training. This evaluation helps gauge how effectively the model generalises
and identifies any issues related to overfitting or underfitting. Various validation methods like
cross-validation can be employed to ensure the model's reliability.
For validation I will be taking images from google images as they will be images not included in the
data set, I will also test against images of my own however I will not include this in my Figures for
privacy reasons.
